# Disney-Python-A-Project
## We will be using python to create line plots of the many different variables that may have affected DIS prices through the years, and overlaying them over each other to compare their trends, with the aims of identifying how correlated they are
1: Maxwell and Sammi

2: What has been the effect of outside factors (such as natural disasters, box office trends, economic trends, etc)(independent variables) on an individual stock performance (DIS)(dependant variable)

3: Admittedly, we have not made much progress in our coding work thus far, as our primary focus has been studying for the exam. Thus far we have managed to upload our data sets, and have begun the process of getting python to read them. Today, we managed to create graphs for the DIS stock data.

4: In the next week or so, we will be graphing out our data using python to investigate how our different data points have affected our dependent variable (DIS price) through the last 50 or so years that we have managed to find data on.

5: We have no preliminary data to report on just yet. As I mentioned above, we have been very focused on the exam from Wednesday. We have managed to create line graphs from the data sets we have collected thus far, which have turned out well.
